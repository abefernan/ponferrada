## Product stages

1. **development**: A build on a developer's machine or CI). This is where the local blockchains run and the tests are executed.
2. **staging**: A production build that uses a config with testnets (Zebranet, Rinkeby, …)
3. **production**: A production build that uses a config with mainnets (BNS, Ethereum, …). Currently unused but prepared.
